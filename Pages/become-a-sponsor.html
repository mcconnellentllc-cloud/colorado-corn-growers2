                <div class="victory-card">
                    <h3>Disaster Program Victories</h3>
                    <p>American agriculture climbed out of a 7-year recession capped by COVID-19 uncertainty and trade war challenges. CCGA's advocacy work has secured well over <strong>$1.2 billion</strong> in critical assistance for Colorado farmers since 2018. Our wins include over $100 million from Market Facilitation Programs, over $400 million from CFAP 1 and 2, over $300 million in ARC and PLC payments, over $200 million in PPP loans, and over $500 million in crop insurance indemnities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Current victories continue</strong> - CCGA's advocacy through SWCA partnerships helped secure ECAP (Emergency Commodity Assistance Program) which has delivered $8 billion nationally for 2024 economic losses. Most critically, SWCA's successful fight to include <strong>excessive heat</strong> as a qualifying peril in SDRP expanded Colorado's eligibility from just 24 drought-designated counties to statewide coverage - potentially multiplying Colorado's share of the $16 billion SDRP program.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="victory-card">
                    <h3>Farm Bill Wins</h3>
                    <p>Every Farm Bill cycle, CCGA fights for provisions that benefit Colorado corn growers. From crop insurance improvements to conservation program enhancements, our advocacy has brought over <strong>$1.2 billion</strong> in support to Colorado agriculture since 2018. Through our SWCA alliance, we secured critical disaster designations and successfully advocated for excessive heat inclusion in federal disaster programs.</p>
                    <p>CCGA continues mounting strong defenses against elimination of stepped-up basis tax policies that would disproportionately affect farm families, while actively promoting "climate smart agriculture" policies that recognize the unique realities of the western Great Plains. Our ongoing partnership with NCGA defends current market access and fights for expanding markets through ethanol and international trade deals.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="victory-card">
                    <h3>Regulatory Relief</h3>
                    <p>CCGA has successfully fought against burdensome labor regulations that threatened Colorado corn producers. When SB-021 proposed unjust labor regulations that would have devastated family farms, CCGA advocated aggressively alongside strong allies like <strong>Senator Cleave Simpson</strong> and <strong>Senator Rod Pelton</strong> to defend Colorado agriculture.</p>
                    <p>Senator Simpson, a Colorado rancher and farmer who serves as general manager of the Rio Grande Water Conservation District, understands that agriculture faces unique challenges. Senator Byron Pelton has sponsored legislation to repeal certain provisions that prohibit employers from interfering with agricultural employees' access to service providers. Our regulatory advocacy has saved Colorado corn growers millions in compliance costs while protecting the viability of family farming operations across the state.</p>

                <div class="victory-card">
                    <h3>Taking on the Corn Belt</h3>
                    <p>We've challenged the Corn Belt's dominance to ensure Colorado gets equitable opportunities to grow corn. Our advocacy has secured fair treatment in crop insurance, conservation programs, and research funding - ensuring Western agriculture isn't left behind. While other regions had automatic advantages, CCGA fought to level the playing field for Colorado corn growers.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Critical SWCA Victory: Excessive Heat Qualification</h3>
            <p>Without SWCA's successful advocacy to include <strong>excessive heat</strong> as a qualifying peril in SDRP, Colorado would have been limited to just 24 drought-designated counties for disaster payments. This single advocacy victory potentially <strong>multiplied Colorado's SDRP payments by several times over</strong> what drought-only qualification would have provided, bringing millions more in disaster relief to Colorado corn producers statewide.</p>
