            <h2>Volunteer Leadership</h2>
            <p>Our board consists of dedicated Colorado corn producers who volunteer their time, energy, and passion to ensure CCGA represents the best interests of all Colorado corn growers. These are not paid administrators - they are working farmers who understand the daily challenges of agricultural production.</p>
            
            <div class="commitment-highlight">
                Most every Friday morning, you'll find our board members on phone calls with lobbyists, politicians, and policy makers. Because Washington never stops, and neither do we.
            </div>
            
            <p>This persistent advocacy is why we've secured over $1.2 billion in assistance for Colorado agriculture since 2018. It's not luck - it's hard work by volunteers who understand that survival requires constant vigilance.</p>

            <h2>Proven Leadership, Real Results</h2>
            <p>This volunteer board has delivered over $1.2 billion in assistance for Colorado agriculture since 2018. From Market Facilitation Programs to SDRP victories, from regulatory relief to farm bill advocacy - these results come from dedication, not luck.</p>
            <p>Every Friday morning, while others sleep in, our board members are on calls with Washington lobbyists, policymakers, and agricultural leaders. This is the commitment that separates CCGA from organizations that just collect fees and hold meetings.</p>
            <p>When disaster strikes, when policies threaten, when opportunities arise - CCGA's board is already working, already advocating, already fighting for Colorado corn growers.</p>
