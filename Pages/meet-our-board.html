            <h2>Volunteer Leadership</h2>
            <p>Our board consists of dedicated Colorado corn producers who volunteer their time, energy, and passion to ensure CCGA represents the best interests of all Colorado corn growers. These are not paid administrators - they are working farmers who understand the daily challenges of agricultural production.</p>
            
            <div class="commitment-highlight">
                Most every Friday morning, you'll find our board members on phone calls with lobbyists, politicians, and policy makers. Because Washington never stops, and neither do we.
            </div>
            
            <p>This persistent advocacy is why we've secured over $1.2 billion in assistance for Colorado agriculture since 2018. It's not luck - it's hard work by volunteers who understand that survival requires constant vigilance.</p>
